== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I customize abc? =

Most likely because a filter does not yet exist within WooCommerce, or a filter does exist but is too complicated to be of use with this plugin.

= Why don't the settings show up under the WooCommerce Settings? =

Do you have this network activated for a multisite installation? If so, you'll need to remove the plugin, then activate it on each child site as needed, as the plugin does not support being network activated.
